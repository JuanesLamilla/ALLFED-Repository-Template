* Keep the code well documented. 
* Every function needs a docstring in this form:
```
def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):
  """
  Explanation of what the function does
  
  Parameter explanation:
  parameter1: Explanation of what it contains and its type
  ...
  
  Return value:

```
  
  



# Acknowledgment
This is strongly based on the ["Good Research Code Handbook"](https://goodresearch.dev/index.html). If something here confuses you, it makes sense to read about it there. Pretty good explanations.
